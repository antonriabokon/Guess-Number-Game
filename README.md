🎯 Simple Number Guessing Game

Think you can outsmart the mystery number? Here’s how to play:

- The game secretly picks a number between 1 and 20 (inclusive).

- Enter your guesses—any whole number in that range is fair game.

- After each guess, you’ll learn whether your number is too high, too low, or spot on.

- You start with a set score. Each wrong guess lowers your score by 1.

- If your score drops to 0, it’s Game Over!

Your mission: Guess the secret number before your score runs out. Good luck! 🏆
